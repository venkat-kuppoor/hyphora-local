Webhook management in CollabVault enables real-time event-driven integrations with external systems while maintaining the security and reliability required for enterprise deployments. The webhook infrastructure processes millions of events daily, delivering notifications about platform activities to registered endpoints with guaranteed delivery semantics and comprehensive error handling. All webhook configurations are subject to approval workflows defined in the [[compliance-framework|compliance framework]] and access controls from the [[rbac-model|RBAC model]].

The webhook system implements sophisticated filtering and transformation capabilities, allowing organizations to subscribe to specific event types and customize payloads to match their integration requirements. Events are automatically filtered based on [[data-classification|classification levels]] and access permissions, ensuring that webhook consumers only receive information they're authorized to access. The system supports both push and pull models, with secure webhook endpoints protected by [[multi-factor-authentication|MFA-backed]] API keys and payload signing for authenticity verification.

Advanced webhook features include automatic retry with exponential backoff, circuit breaker patterns to handle failing endpoints, and detailed delivery tracking in the [[audit-logs|audit logs]]. The system provides webhook debugging tools that capture failed deliveries for troubleshooting while respecting data sensitivity. Integration with the [[api-gateway|API gateway]] enables rate limiting and threat detection for webhook endpoints, while the [[real-time-monitoring|monitoring system]] provides visibility into webhook performance and reliability metrics across all configured integrations.
