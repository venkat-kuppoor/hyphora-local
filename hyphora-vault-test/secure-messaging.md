Secure messaging in CollabVault provides real-time communication capabilities that meet the stringent security requirements of regulated industries while maintaining the user experience expected from modern collaboration platforms. Built on a foundation of [[end-to-end-encryption|end-to-end encryption]], the messaging system ensures that conversations remain confidential from the moment they're typed until they're displayed on authorized recipients' screens. The architecture supports both one-on-one conversations and group [[message-channels|channels]] with thousands of participants without compromising security or performance.

The messaging infrastructure implements advanced security features including forward secrecy through automatic key rotation managed by the [[encryption-key-management|key management system]], message authentication to prevent tampering, and perfect deniability for sensitive communications. Each message is tagged with [[data-classification|classification metadata]] that travels with the content, ensuring appropriate handling throughout its lifecycle. The system supports rich media messaging including files, images, and interactive content, all protected by the same security mechanisms and subject to [[content-moderation|moderation policies]].

Unique capabilities include ephemeral messaging with cryptographically enforced deletion after specified time periods, secure message editing with complete version tracking in the [[audit-logs|audit system]], and message threading that maintains context while respecting [[access-control|access permissions]]. The messaging system integrates with the [[notification-system|notification infrastructure]] for reliable delivery across devices while the [[threat-detection|threat detection engine]] monitors for anomalous messaging patterns. All message data respects [[data-retention-policy|retention requirements]] with automated archival and disposal based on regulatory mandates.
