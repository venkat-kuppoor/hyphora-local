CollabVault's zero trust architecture fundamentally assumes that no user, device, or network should be inherently trusted, requiring continuous verification for every interaction within the platform. This architectural principle permeates every layer of the system, from network micro-segmentation that isolates [[workspace-isolation|workspaces]] to granular [[access-control|access decisions]] that evaluate each request based on real-time risk assessment. The zero trust model extends beyond traditional perimeter security to provide defense in depth against both external threats and insider risks.

The implementation leverages multiple verification factors including user identity validated through [[multi-factor-authentication|MFA]], device health assessed by [[mobile-device-management|MDM policies]], network location, behavioral patterns analyzed by the [[threat-detection|threat detection system]], and contextual factors such as time of day and [[data-classification|data sensitivity]]. Each component in the architecture operates with least privilege principles enforced by the [[rbac-model|RBAC system]], and all inter-service communications are mutually authenticated and encrypted using certificates managed by the [[encryption-key-management|key management infrastructure]].

Zero trust principles guide critical architectural decisions throughout CollabVault, including the design of the [[api-gateway|API gateway]] that validates every request, the [[session-management|session system]] that continuously re-evaluates trust levels, and the [[audit-logs|audit infrastructure]] that provides immutable records of all trust decisions. The architecture supports gradual trust degradation where suspicious activities result in stepped-up authentication requirements rather than binary access decisions, maintaining usability while ensuring security. Integration with the [[compliance-framework|compliance framework]] ensures that zero trust controls satisfy regulatory requirements while the [[performance-analytics|analytics platform]] monitors the impact of trust decisions on user productivity.
