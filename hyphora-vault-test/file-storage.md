CollabVault's file storage architecture provides secure, scalable, and compliant storage for all platform assets including documents, media files, and attachments shared within [[message-channels|message channels]] and [[wiki-pages|wiki pages]]. The storage system implements a multi-tier architecture with hot, warm, and cold storage tiers, automatically moving files between tiers based on access patterns and [[data-retention-policy|retention requirements]] while maintaining consistent security controls throughout the data lifecycle.

Every file stored in CollabVault is encrypted at rest using envelope encryption with keys managed through a sophisticated key hierarchy that integrates with the [[end-to-end-encryption|E2EE system]]. Files are chunked and distributed across multiple storage locations for redundancy and performance, with each chunk encrypted independently to prevent large-scale data breaches. The storage system enforces [[data-classification|classification-based]] handling rules, automatically applying stronger encryption and access restrictions to files containing sensitive information identified by the content analysis pipeline.

The storage architecture supports advanced features including deduplication at the block level to optimize storage costs while maintaining logical separation between [[workspace-isolation|workspaces]], content-aware compression that preserves searchability for the [[search-indexing|search system]], and immutable storage options for compliance-critical documents. Integration with the [[audit-logs|audit logging system]] provides complete visibility into file access patterns, while the [[real-time-monitoring|monitoring infrastructure]] tracks storage health metrics and automatically handles failures through self-healing mechanisms that ensure business continuity.
