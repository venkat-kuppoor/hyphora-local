User provisioning in CollabVault automates the complete lifecycle of user account management from initial creation through role assignments to eventual deprovisioning, ensuring consistent application of security policies while reducing administrative overhead. The provisioning system integrates with enterprise identity providers through [[single-sign-on|SSO protocols]] and supports both push and pull synchronization models, automatically creating and updating user accounts based on authoritative sources while respecting [[compliance-framework|compliance requirements]].

The provisioning engine implements sophisticated attribute mapping and transformation rules that translate organizational identity data into platform-specific configurations. When new users are provisioned, the system automatically assigns appropriate [[rbac-model|RBAC roles]] based on department, job function, and manager hierarchy, grants access to relevant [[workspace-isolation|workspaces]], and configures [[data-classification|classification-based]] permissions. The engine maintains detailed provisioning history in the [[audit-logs|audit logs]], providing complete visibility into who approved access grants and what resources were assigned.

Advanced provisioning features include just-in-time access that creates temporary accounts for [[guest-sharing|guest users]], automated deprovisioning workflows triggered by HR system events, and orphaned account detection that identifies accounts no longer linked to active employees. The system enforces segregation of duties by requiring multiple approvals for privileged access provisioning and integrates with the [[threat-detection|threat detection system]] to identify suspicious provisioning patterns that might indicate insider threats or compromised administrative accounts.
