Automated workflows in CollabVault enable organizations to codify and streamline their business processes while maintaining security and compliance requirements. The workflow engine supports complex, multi-step processes that can span across different [[workspace-isolation|workspaces]], interact with external systems through [[integration-connectors|connectors]], and enforce approval chains based on [[rbac-model|RBAC roles]] and [[data-classification|data sensitivity]]. Each workflow execution is fully auditable through the [[audit-logs|audit system]], providing complete visibility into process flow and decision points.

The workflow designer provides a visual interface for creating processes using pre-built actions and conditions, with the underlying workflow definitions stored as code that can be version-controlled through the [[versioning-system|versioning system]]. Workflows can be triggered by various events including [[message-channels|channel messages]], document updates in [[wiki-pages|wiki pages]], scheduled times, or API calls through the [[api-gateway|API gateway]]. The engine implements sophisticated error handling with automatic retry, compensating transactions, and manual intervention capabilities when automated resolution isn't possible.

Advanced workflow capabilities include parallel execution branches with synchronization points, dynamic routing based on runtime conditions, and integration with the [[compliance-engine|compliance engine]] to ensure all automated actions comply with policy requirements. The workflow system provides comprehensive analytics through the [[performance-analytics|performance platform]], enabling process optimization and bottleneck identification. Security features include workflow signing to prevent tampering, encryption of workflow state using the [[encryption-key-management|key management system]], and automatic suspension of workflows that exhibit anomalous behavior detected by the [[threat-detection|threat detection system]].
