Integration connectors in CollabVault provide pre-built, secure connections to popular enterprise applications and services, enabling seamless data flow while maintaining the platform's strict security and compliance standards. Each connector is built on a standardized framework that enforces [[access-control|access controls]], implements [[data-classification|classification-aware]] data handling, and provides comprehensive [[audit-logs|audit logging]] for all integration activities. The connector architecture supports both real-time synchronization and batch processing modes, adapting to the requirements of different external systems.

The connector framework implements sophisticated data transformation capabilities that map between CollabVault's internal data models and external system schemas while preserving semantic meaning and security context. Sensitive data identified by the [[data-loss-prevention|DLP system]] is automatically filtered or transformed according to policy before transmission, and all external communications are protected by [[end-to-end-encryption|encryption]] with mutual authentication. Connectors respect [[workspace-isolation|workspace boundaries]], ensuring that integrations cannot inadvertently bridge security domains.

Advanced connector features include intelligent conflict resolution for bidirectional synchronization, automatic retry with circuit breaker patterns for reliability, and performance optimization through the [[api-gateway|API gateway's]] caching and rate limiting capabilities. The connector ecosystem is extensible, allowing organizations to build custom connectors using a secure SDK that enforces platform security policies. All connector configurations undergo approval workflows managed by the [[compliance-engine|compliance engine]], and connector health is continuously monitored through the [[real-time-monitoring|monitoring infrastructure]] with automatic alerting for integration failures.
