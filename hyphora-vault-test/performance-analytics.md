Performance analytics in CollabVault provides deep insights into system performance, user experience metrics, and resource utilization patterns, enabling continuous optimization of the platform while maintaining security and privacy requirements. The analytics engine collects telemetry data from all platform components, aggregates metrics while respecting [[workspace-isolation|workspace boundaries]], and applies privacy-preserving techniques to ensure that performance monitoring doesn't compromise sensitive information protected by [[data-classification|classification policies]].

The system tracks key performance indicators including response times, throughput, error rates, and resource consumption across different platform services. Advanced correlation algorithms identify performance bottlenecks by analyzing relationships between metrics, user activities logged in the [[audit-logs|audit system]], and infrastructure events. The analytics platform provides predictive capabilities that forecast future performance issues based on historical patterns and current trends, enabling proactive optimization before users experience degradation.

Performance data is visualized through customizable dashboards that respect [[rbac-model|RBAC permissions]], ensuring teams only see metrics relevant to their responsibilities. The analytics system integrates with the [[api-gateway|API gateway]] to track integration performance, the [[search-indexing|search infrastructure]] to optimize query performance, and the [[file-storage|storage system]] to manage capacity planning. All performance data is retained according to [[data-retention-policy|retention policies]] and can be exported for advanced analysis while maintaining compliance with privacy regulations through automatic data anonymization.
