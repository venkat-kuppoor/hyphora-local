CollabVault's disaster recovery architecture ensures business continuity through comprehensive backup strategies, automated failover mechanisms, and rapid recovery procedures that maintain data integrity and security even during catastrophic events. The system implements a multi-region deployment model with continuous data replication that respects [[data-governance|data sovereignty requirements]] and [[compliance-framework|compliance mandates]] while providing recovery time objectives (RTO) and recovery point objectives (RPO) suitable for mission-critical operations.

The disaster recovery infrastructure maintains encrypted backups of all platform data including user content, [[audit-logs|audit logs]], configuration settings, and cryptographic materials needed for [[end-to-end-encryption|decryption]]. Backups are distributed across geographically diverse locations with different risk profiles, protected by immutable storage policies that prevent ransomware attacks. The system performs continuous backup validation through automated restoration tests, ensuring that recovery procedures will function correctly when needed while maintaining [[workspace-isolation|workspace isolation]] throughout the recovery process.

Recovery procedures are fully automated with manual override capabilities for complex scenarios, orchestrated through runbooks that are regularly tested and updated. The disaster recovery system integrates with the [[real-time-monitoring|monitoring infrastructure]] to detect failures and initiate failover procedures automatically when predefined thresholds are exceeded. During recovery operations, the [[notification-system|notification system]] keeps stakeholders informed of progress while the [[rbac-model|RBAC system]] ensures that emergency access procedures maintain appropriate authorization controls even under crisis conditions.
