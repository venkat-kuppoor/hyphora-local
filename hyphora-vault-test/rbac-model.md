CollabVault implements a sophisticated Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) model that extends beyond traditional permission systems to meet the complex authorization requirements of regulated enterprises. The model incorporates dynamic role assignment, attribute-based constraints, and temporal access controls, enabling organizations to implement the principle of least privilege while maintaining operational flexibility through the [[access-control|access control system]].

The RBAC implementation utilizes a hierarchical role structure where permissions cascade through organizational units, but can be overridden at any level to accommodate exceptions. Each role is composed of granular permissions that control access to specific features, data categories, and operations within the platform. The system supports role delegation, allowing temporary elevation of privileges for specific tasks, with all delegations tracked through the [[audit-logs|audit logging system]] and subject to approval workflows defined in the [[compliance-framework|compliance framework]].

A unique aspect of CollabVault's RBAC model is its integration with the [[data-classification|data classification system]], where access permissions are automatically adjusted based on the sensitivity level of the content being accessed. This dynamic permission adjustment ensures that users can only access information appropriate to their clearance level, even when collaborating in shared [[workspace-isolation|workspaces]]. The model also supports cross-organization roles for [[guest-sharing|guest users]] and external collaborators, maintaining strict isolation while enabling controlled information sharing.
