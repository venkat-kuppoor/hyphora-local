Message channels in CollabVault provide structured spaces for team communication that combine the immediacy of instant messaging with the security and compliance requirements of regulated industries. Each channel operates within defined [[workspace-isolation|workspace boundaries]] with granular permissions managed through the [[rbac-model|RBAC model]], ensuring that sensitive discussions remain confidential while enabling efficient collaboration across authorized team members.

Channels support rich messaging capabilities including threaded conversations, file attachments, code snippets, and interactive embeds from integrated systems. All content shared within channels undergoes automatic [[data-classification|classification]] and is protected by [[end-to-end-encryption|end-to-end encryption]], with the platform enforcing appropriate handling based on the highest classification level of any message in the conversation. The [[versioning-system|versioning system]] maintains complete message history, enabling teams to reference past discussions while meeting [[compliance-framework|compliance requirements]] for communication retention.

Advanced channel features include automated moderation powered by natural language processing that detects potential compliance violations or inappropriate content sharing before messages are delivered. Channels can be configured with custom retention policies through the [[data-retention-policy|retention system]], approval workflows for sensitive topics, and integration with the [[wiki-pages|wiki system]] for automatic knowledge extraction. The [[real-time-monitoring|monitoring system]] tracks channel health metrics, identifying inactive channels for archival and detecting unusual activity patterns that might indicate security concerns.
