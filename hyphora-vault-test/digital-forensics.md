Digital forensics capabilities in CollabVault provide comprehensive tools for investigating security incidents, policy violations, and potential criminal activities while maintaining the integrity of evidence and respecting privacy rights. The forensics platform creates forensically sound images of relevant data and system states, maintaining strict chain of custody documentation that meets legal standards for admissibility in court proceedings. Integration with the [[blockchain-audit-trail|blockchain audit system]] provides cryptographic proof of evidence integrity from collection through analysis.

The forensics infrastructure supports both live analysis of running systems and post-incident investigation of preserved data, with specialized tools for analyzing [[message-channels|communications]], [[file-storage|document modifications]], [[secure-video-conferencing|meeting recordings]], and user activity patterns recorded in [[audit-logs|audit logs]]. The system can reconstruct complete timelines of user activities, identify deleted or modified content through the [[versioning-system|versioning system]], and perform correlation analysis across multiple data sources to understand complex incident scenarios.

Advanced forensics capabilities include network forensics that analyzes traffic patterns and communication metadata, mobile device forensics integrated with [[mobile-device-management|MDM systems]], and cloud forensics that can investigate activities across distributed infrastructure. The platform provides specialized analysis tools for different types of investigations including intellectual property theft detected by [[data-loss-prevention|DLP systems]], insider threats identified by [[insider-threat-detection|behavioral analytics]], and [[advanced-persistent-threat-protection|APT campaigns]]. All forensics activities are conducted within isolated environments that prevent contamination of evidence, with results documented in formats suitable for legal proceedings and regulatory reporting.
