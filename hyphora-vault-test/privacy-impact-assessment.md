Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) capabilities in CollabVault provide automated tools for evaluating the privacy implications of new features, data processing activities, and system changes before they are implemented. The PIA system analyzes proposed changes against privacy regulations including GDPR, CCPA, and sector-specific requirements, identifying potential privacy risks and recommending mitigation strategies. This proactive approach ensures that privacy considerations are integrated into development processes rather than addressed retroactively, reducing compliance risks and protecting individual privacy rights.

The PIA platform leverages the [[data-classification|data classification system]] to understand what types of personal information might be affected by proposed changes, and integrates with the [[knowledge-graph|knowledge graph]] to map data flows and identify all systems and processes that might be impacted. The assessment process includes automated analysis of consent mechanisms, data minimization practices, and retention periods defined in [[data-retention-policy|retention policies]], generating comprehensive reports that can be submitted to data protection authorities when required.

Advanced PIA features include threshold analysis that determines when formal assessments are required based on risk levels and regulatory requirements, collaborative assessment workflows that engage relevant stakeholders including legal, security, and business teams through [[automated-workflows|workflow systems]], and continuous monitoring that updates assessments when system configurations or regulations change. The PIA system maintains historical records of all assessments in the [[audit-logs|audit system]], enabling organizations to demonstrate their commitment to privacy by design. Integration with [[regulatory-compliance-automation|compliance automation]] ensures that PIA processes evolve with changing privacy regulations and organizational requirements.
