The search indexing system in CollabVault provides high-performance, security-aware full-text search capabilities across all platform content while respecting access controls and data boundaries. Unlike traditional search engines, CollabVault's indexing infrastructure maintains separate encrypted indices for each [[workspace-isolation|workspace]] and security classification level, ensuring that search results never leak information across security boundaries defined by the [[access-control|access control system]].

The indexing pipeline processes content in real-time as it enters the platform, extracting text from various formats, identifying entities and relationships for the [[knowledge-graph|knowledge graph]], and applying natural language processing to understand semantic meaning. Each indexed document maintains metadata about its [[data-classification|classification level]], access permissions from the [[rbac-model|RBAC model]], and temporal validity based on [[data-retention-policy|retention policies]]. The system uses homomorphic encryption techniques that allow searching within encrypted indices without decrypting the underlying content.

Advanced indexing features include multilingual support with automatic language detection, fuzzy matching for typo tolerance, and concept expansion using machine learning models trained on organizational terminology. The indexing system integrates with the [[versioning-system|versioning system]] to provide point-in-time search capabilities and with the [[audit-logs|audit logs]] to track all search queries for security monitoring. Performance optimization includes intelligent caching, distributed index sharding, and query result pre-computation for frequently accessed content, all while maintaining the strict security isolation required by the [[compliance-framework|compliance framework]].
