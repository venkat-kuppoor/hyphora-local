Single Sign-On (SSO) capabilities in CollabVault enable seamless authentication across the platform while maintaining the security standards required by regulated industries. The SSO implementation supports major identity providers through SAML 2.0, OAuth 2.0, and OpenID Connect protocols, allowing organizations to leverage their existing identity infrastructure while benefiting from CollabVault's enhanced security features including [[multi-factor-authentication|multi-factor authentication]] and [[access-control|dynamic access control]].

The SSO architecture implements a zero-trust approach where authentication tokens are continuously validated and refreshed based on risk assessment and session activity. Integration with the [[compliance-engine|compliance engine]] ensures that SSO sessions respect regulatory requirements for session timeouts, re-authentication intervals, and geographic restrictions. The system maintains cryptographic proof of authentication events in the [[audit-logs|audit logs]], providing non-repudiation for all access attempts and supporting forensic investigations when required.

CollabVault's SSO implementation uniquely supports multi-organization scenarios where users may need access to resources across different security domains. The platform manages these complex authentication flows while maintaining strict [[workspace-isolation|workspace isolation]], ensuring that SSO convenience doesn't compromise security boundaries. Advanced features include just-in-time provisioning that automatically creates user accounts based on SSO assertions while applying appropriate [[rbac-model|RBAC roles]] and [[data-classification|classification-based]] access restrictions.
