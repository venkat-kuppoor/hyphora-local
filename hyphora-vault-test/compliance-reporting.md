Compliance reporting in CollabVault provides comprehensive, automated generation of reports required for regulatory audits, internal governance reviews, and executive oversight. The reporting engine aggregates data from across the platform including [[audit-logs|audit logs]], [[access-control|access control records]], [[data-classification|classification metrics]], and policy violations detected by the [[compliance-engine|compliance engine]]. Reports are generated using tamper-proof methods with cryptographic signatures that ensure authenticity and can be validated by external auditors.

The system supports a wide range of pre-built report templates for common regulatory frameworks including SOC 2, HIPAA, GDPR, and FINRA, while also enabling custom report creation through a flexible report builder. Reports can incorporate data from multiple time periods, compare against benchmarks, and include trend analysis that helps organizations demonstrate continuous improvement in their compliance posture. The reporting infrastructure respects [[workspace-isolation|workspace boundaries]] and [[rbac-model|access permissions]], ensuring that report viewers only see data they're authorized to access.

Advanced reporting features include automated report scheduling with distribution through secure channels, exception-based reporting that highlights deviations from expected patterns, and drill-down capabilities that allow investigators to examine specific incidents while maintaining audit trails. Reports can be exported in various formats suitable for different audiences, from detailed technical logs for auditors to executive dashboards for board presentations. The [[performance-analytics|analytics platform]] tracks report usage and effectiveness, while integration with [[automated-workflows|workflow systems]] enables report-triggered remediation actions for identified compliance gaps.
