CollabVault's data classification system automatically categorizes information based on sensitivity, regulatory requirements, and business impact, enabling consistent application of security controls across the enterprise. The classification engine uses a combination of rule-based patterns, machine learning models, and user-defined policies to analyze content in real-time, assigning appropriate classification labels that drive downstream security decisions throughout the [[data-governance|data governance framework]].

The system supports multiple classification taxonomies simultaneously, accommodating various regulatory frameworks and organizational schemes while maintaining mappings between different classification systems. Each piece of content receives both a primary classification (such as Public, Internal, Confidential, or Restricted) and secondary tags that identify specific regulatory concerns like personally identifiable information (PII), protected health information (PHI), or material non-public information (MNPI). These classifications directly influence [[access-control|access control decisions]], [[end-to-end-encryption|encryption requirements]], and retention policies defined in the [[data-retention-policy|data retention policy]].

Classification decisions are transparent and auditable, with the system maintaining detailed metadata about why specific classifications were applied, including confidence scores and triggering rules. Users can request reclassification through governed workflows that ensure appropriate review and approval, with all changes tracked in the [[audit-logs|audit logs]]. The classification system also supports inheritance and propagation, where derived content automatically inherits the highest classification level of its sources, preventing inadvertent information disclosure through data transformation or aggregation.
