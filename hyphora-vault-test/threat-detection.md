CollabVault's threat detection system employs advanced machine learning algorithms and behavioral analytics to identify potential security incidents before they can cause damage. The system continuously analyzes patterns across user activities, data access, and system operations, correlating signals from the [[audit-logs|audit logs]], [[real-time-monitoring|monitoring infrastructure]], and external threat intelligence feeds to detect both known attack patterns and zero-day threats.

The detection engine builds behavioral baselines for each user, understanding their typical access patterns, collaboration networks, and data usage. Deviations from these baselines trigger risk scoring algorithms that consider contextual factors from the [[rbac-model|RBAC system]], [[data-classification|data sensitivity]], and current threat landscape. The system distinguishes between legitimate anomalies, such as employees taking on new responsibilities, and genuine threats by incorporating feedback from the [[access-control|access control system]] and organizational change management processes.

When threats are detected, the system can automatically initiate response actions ranging from enhanced logging and alerting to temporary access suspension, depending on the severity and confidence level. All detection events are recorded with full context in the [[compliance-framework|compliance audit trail]], and the system provides detailed forensic timelines that help security teams understand attack progression. Integration with the [[knowledge-graph|knowledge graph]] enables the detection system to identify lateral movement attempts and data exfiltration patterns that might otherwise go unnoticed in traditional security monitoring.
