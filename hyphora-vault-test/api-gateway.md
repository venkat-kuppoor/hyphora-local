The API Gateway serves as the unified entry point for all programmatic access to CollabVault, providing a secure, scalable interface that enforces consistent security policies while enabling integration with external systems. Built on a microservices architecture, the gateway implements sophisticated rate limiting, request validation, and protocol translation, ensuring that all API calls comply with the [[compliance-framework|compliance framework]] and respect [[access-control|access control policies]].

Every API request passes through multiple security layers including [[multi-factor-authentication|MFA verification]] for sensitive operations, automatic threat detection through the [[threat-detection|threat detection system]], and comprehensive logging to the [[audit-logs|audit infrastructure]]. The gateway supports multiple authentication mechanisms including OAuth 2.0, API keys with HMAC signatures, and mutual TLS for system-to-system communication. Request and response payloads are automatically scanned for sensitive data based on [[data-classification|classification rules]], with the gateway enforcing encryption and masking policies as required.

The API Gateway provides intelligent routing capabilities that direct requests to appropriate backend services while maintaining [[workspace-isolation|workspace isolation]] and enforcing tenant boundaries. Advanced features include request transformation for legacy system compatibility, response caching with security-aware invalidation, and webhook management for event-driven integrations. The gateway integrates with the [[real-time-monitoring|monitoring system]] to provide detailed analytics on API usage patterns, helping organizations identify optimization opportunities while detecting potential abuse or unauthorized access attempts.
