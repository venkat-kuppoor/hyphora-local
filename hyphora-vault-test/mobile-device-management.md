Mobile Device Management (MDM) capabilities in CollabVault ensure secure access to platform resources from mobile devices while maintaining compliance with organizational security policies and regulatory requirements. The MDM system enforces device compliance checks before granting access, verifying factors such as operating system version, security patch level, jailbreak/root status, and presence of required security software. These checks integrate with the [[access-control|access control system]] to provide context-aware authorization decisions based on device trust levels.

The MDM implementation supports both corporate-owned and bring-your-own-device (BYOD) scenarios through containerization technology that creates secure enclaves on mobile devices. Within these containers, CollabVault data is protected by [[end-to-end-encryption|additional encryption layers]] and governed by policies that prevent data leakage through copy/paste restrictions, screenshot blocking, and controlled sharing mechanisms. The system maintains detailed device inventories in the [[audit-logs|audit logs]] and can perform remote wipe operations for lost or compromised devices while preserving personal data in BYOD scenarios.

Advanced MDM features include geofencing that restricts access based on physical location, time-based access controls aligned with work schedules, and integration with mobile threat defense solutions through the [[threat-detection|threat detection system]]. The MDM infrastructure provides analytics through the [[performance-analytics|performance analytics platform]] to identify device-related issues and optimize mobile user experience. All MDM policies are configured through the [[compliance-framework|compliance framework]] and can be customized based on [[data-classification|data sensitivity levels]] and user [[rbac-model|roles]].
