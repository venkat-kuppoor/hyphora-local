Secure file sharing in CollabVault enables controlled distribution of sensitive documents both within the organization and to external parties while maintaining comprehensive security controls and audit trails. The file sharing system builds upon the [[file-storage|storage infrastructure]] and [[end-to-end-encryption|encryption capabilities]] to provide granular control over who can access files, what they can do with them, and for how long. Each shared file maintains its [[data-classification|classification level]] and enforces appropriate handling requirements regardless of how it's accessed.

The sharing mechanism supports various distribution models including direct user shares with specific [[rbac-model|RBAC permissions]], link-based sharing with configurable expiration and access limits, and secure rooms for collaborative document review. Advanced controls include watermarking with recipient information, view-only modes that prevent downloading, and real-time revocation capabilities that immediately terminate access even for previously downloaded files through digital rights management. All sharing activities generate detailed entries in the [[audit-logs|audit system]] for compliance tracking.

Integration with the [[data-loss-prevention|DLP system]] ensures that files containing sensitive information cannot be shared inappropriately, while the [[threat-detection|threat detection engine]] monitors for suspicious sharing patterns that might indicate data exfiltration attempts. The file sharing interface provides rich analytics on share usage, including access patterns, geographic distribution, and device types, helping organizations understand how their information spreads. [[Guest-sharing|External recipients]] receive files through secure portals that enforce the same security policies as internal users while maintaining simplified user experience.
