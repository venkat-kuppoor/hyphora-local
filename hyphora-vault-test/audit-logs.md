The audit logging system in CollabVault provides comprehensive, tamper-proof records of all activities within the platform, serving as both a security monitoring tool and a compliance requirement. Every action, from user authentication to document modifications, generates detailed log entries that capture the who, what, when, where, and why of each operation. These logs are essential for meeting regulatory requirements outlined in the [[compliance-framework|compliance framework]] and investigating security incidents.

Each audit log entry is cryptographically signed and linked to the previous entry, creating an immutable chain of records that cannot be altered without detection. The logging system captures not just successful operations but also failed attempts, providing visibility into potential security threats or misconfigured permissions within the [[rbac-model|RBAC model]]. Log entries include contextual metadata such as IP addresses, device fingerprints, and session identifiers, enabling detailed forensic analysis when required.

The audit logs integrate seamlessly with the platform's [[real-time-monitoring|real-time monitoring system]], which can trigger alerts based on predefined patterns or anomalies. Organizations can configure retention policies that comply with their specific regulatory requirements through the [[data-retention-policy|data retention policy system]], with automatic archival to cold storage for long-term preservation. Advanced querying capabilities allow compliance officers and security teams to efficiently search through millions of log entries, generate compliance reports, and demonstrate adherence to regulatory standards during audits.
