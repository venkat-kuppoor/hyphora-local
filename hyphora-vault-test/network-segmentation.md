Network segmentation in CollabVault provides defense-in-depth protection by creating isolated network zones that mirror the platform's logical [[workspace-isolation|workspace isolation]] model at the network layer. Each security domain operates within its own network segment with carefully controlled ingress and egress rules that prevent lateral movement between segments even if individual components are compromised. This segmentation extends from the data center through cloud deployments to user endpoints, creating a comprehensive security architecture that limits attack surfaces and blast radius.

The segmentation architecture implements microsegmentation at the application level using software-defined networking that can dynamically adjust network policies based on real-time threat intelligence from the [[threat-detection|threat detection system]] and access decisions from the [[zero-trust-architecture|zero trust framework]]. Traffic between segments is encrypted and authenticated, with all inter-segment communications logged in the [[audit-logs|audit system]] for security monitoring and compliance reporting. The network infrastructure supports rapid containment capabilities that can isolate compromised segments within seconds of threat detection.

Advanced segmentation features include adaptive network policies that automatically adjust based on [[data-classification|data sensitivity]] and user [[rbac-model|roles]], network behavior analysis that detects anomalous traffic patterns indicative of attack activities, and integration with [[containerization-security|container security]] to ensure that network segmentation extends to containerized applications. The segmentation system provides comprehensive visibility through the [[performance-analytics|analytics platform]], enabling network administrators to optimize performance while maintaining security boundaries. Emergency response capabilities allow [[incident-response|incident response teams]] to rapidly reconfigure network segmentation during active attacks while maintaining business continuity for unaffected segments.
