The knowledge graph in CollabVault represents the interconnected web of organizational information, providing a semantic layer that transforms isolated documents and conversations into a navigable network of related concepts. Unlike traditional folder-based systems, the knowledge graph enables users to discover information through relationships, making implicit connections explicit and facilitating serendipitous discovery of relevant content across the [[workspace-isolation|isolated workspaces]].

Built on a graph database architecture, the system automatically extracts entities, relationships, and metadata from all content within the platform, including messages, documents, and [[wiki-pages|wiki pages]]. Natural language processing algorithms identify key concepts and create bidirectional links between related information, while machine learning models continuously refine these connections based on user interactions and feedback. The graph respects the [[rbac-model|RBAC permissions]], ensuring users only see connections to content they are authorized to access.

The knowledge graph powers several critical features including intelligent search, content recommendations, and impact analysis for proposed changes. When users search for information, the graph traversal algorithms consider not just direct matches but also related concepts and contextual relevance, significantly improving discovery of buried knowledge. Integration with the [[versioning-system|versioning system]] allows the graph to maintain temporal relationships, showing how knowledge evolved over time while preserving the complete history for [[compliance-framework|compliance]] purposes.
