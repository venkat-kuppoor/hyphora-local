Session management in CollabVault implements sophisticated controls that balance security requirements with user experience, ensuring that authentication states are properly maintained while preventing session-based attacks. The system uses cryptographically secure session tokens that are bound to device fingerprints and network characteristics, making session hijacking extremely difficult. Each session is continuously evaluated against risk factors including user behavior, [[access-control|access patterns]], and [[threat-detection|threat intelligence]], with the ability to require re-authentication through [[multi-factor-authentication|MFA]] when risk levels change.

The session infrastructure supports complex scenarios required by enterprise environments, including concurrent sessions across multiple devices, session delegation for administrative tasks, and session inheritance for [[single-sign-on|SSO]] scenarios. Session policies are configurable through the [[compliance-framework|compliance framework]] and can vary based on [[data-classification|data sensitivity]], user [[rbac-model|roles]], and [[workspace-isolation|workspace]] requirements. The system implements idle timeout, absolute timeout, and location-based session termination while providing grace periods and warning notifications through the [[notification-system|notification system]].

Advanced session management features include session recording for high-privilege activities with playback capabilities for audit purposes, anonymous session support for specific use cases while maintaining security, and session reputation scoring that influences access decisions. All session events are logged in the [[audit-logs|audit system]] with sufficient detail for forensic analysis, while the [[performance-analytics|analytics platform]] provides insights into session patterns that help optimize timeout policies and identify potential security issues.
