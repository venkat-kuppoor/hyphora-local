API security in CollabVault implements comprehensive protection for all programmatic interfaces, ensuring that external integrations cannot compromise platform security or bypass established controls. Built into the [[api-gateway|API gateway]] architecture, security controls include robust authentication mechanisms, fine-grained authorization checks, and comprehensive input validation that prevents injection attacks and data corruption. Every API endpoint is protected by rate limiting, request signing, and anomaly detection that identifies suspicious usage patterns through integration with the [[threat-detection|threat detection system]].

The API security framework implements OAuth 2.0 with PKCE for public clients, mutual TLS for system-to-system communication, and custom token formats that include contextual information about the requesting application and user. API tokens are short-lived and automatically rotated, with refresh mechanisms that require periodic re-authentication through [[multi-factor-authentication|MFA systems]]. All API requests are evaluated against [[access-control|access policies]] and [[data-classification|classification rules]], ensuring that external applications can only access data they're explicitly authorized to retrieve.

Advanced API security features include API behavior analysis that creates baselines for normal application usage patterns, automated security testing that continuously validates API endpoint security configurations, and integration with [[security-orchestration|security orchestration]] platforms for rapid response to API-based attacks. The security framework supports API versioning with backward compatibility controls and deprecation management that ensures older, potentially vulnerable API versions can be safely retired. All API security events are logged in the [[audit-logs|audit system]] with enhanced detail levels, while [[performance-analytics|performance monitoring]] tracks API usage patterns and security control effectiveness.
