Containerization security in CollabVault provides defense-in-depth protection for the platform's microservices architecture while enabling the scalability and deployment flexibility that containers offer. Each service runs in hardened containers with minimal attack surfaces, implementing the principle of least privilege at the operating system level. Container images undergo rigorous scanning for vulnerabilities before deployment, with the [[compliance-engine|compliance engine]] enforcing policies that prevent containers with known security issues from reaching production environments.

The container orchestration layer implements network policies that mirror CollabVault's [[workspace-isolation|workspace isolation]] model, ensuring that containers can only communicate with authorized services. Runtime security monitoring detects anomalous container behavior such as unexpected process execution or file system modifications, triggering alerts through the [[threat-detection|threat detection system]]. All container activities are logged to the [[audit-logs|audit infrastructure]], including image pulls, container starts and stops, and inter-container communications, providing complete visibility for security investigations.

Advanced container security features include automated secret rotation for container-deployed applications integrated with the [[encryption-key-management|key management system]], admission controllers that validate container configurations against security policies before deployment, and container forensics capabilities that preserve container state for [[incident-response|incident response]] investigations. The platform supports confidential computing where sensitive workloads run in encrypted memory enclaves, protecting data even from privileged system administrators. Integration with the [[zero-trust-architecture|zero trust architecture]] ensures that container-to-container communications are mutually authenticated and encrypted, while the [[performance-analytics|analytics system]] monitors container resource usage to detect potential cryptomining or other abuse.
