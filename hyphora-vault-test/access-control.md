The access control system in CollabVault provides fine-grained authorization mechanisms that determine what resources users can access and what operations they can perform within the platform. Building upon the [[rbac-model|RBAC model]], the access control layer implements a policy decision point (PDP) that evaluates every access request against a comprehensive set of rules, considering factors such as user identity, resource attributes, environmental context, and regulatory constraints defined in the [[compliance-framework|compliance framework]].

Access control policies in CollabVault support both preventive and detective controls, with real-time enforcement preventing unauthorized access attempts while generating detailed [[audit-logs|audit log entries]] for security monitoring. The system implements attribute-based access control (ABAC) capabilities that extend traditional role-based permissions with dynamic attributes such as time of day, location, device trust level, and data sensitivity classifications from the [[data-classification|data classification system]]. This enables context-aware access decisions that adapt to changing risk profiles and compliance requirements.

The architecture supports federated access control across organizational boundaries, enabling secure collaboration with external partners through [[guest-sharing|guest sharing]] capabilities while maintaining strict isolation between tenants. Access tokens are short-lived and cryptographically bound to specific sessions, with continuous re-evaluation of permissions ensuring that access rights reflect current authorization states. The system also implements break-glass procedures for emergency access, with enhanced logging and post-incident review processes to maintain security while ensuring business continuity in critical situations.
