CollabVault's incident response system provides a comprehensive framework for detecting, investigating, and remediating security incidents while maintaining detailed forensic records for post-incident analysis. When the [[threat-detection|threat detection system]] or [[real-time-monitoring|monitoring infrastructure]] identifies potential security incidents, the incident response module automatically initiates containment procedures, preserves evidence through [[legal-hold|legal hold mechanisms]], and orchestrates response workflows based on incident type and severity.

The incident response platform integrates all relevant data sources including [[audit-logs|audit logs]], [[activity-feeds|activity timelines]], [[access-control|access records]], and system metrics to provide investigators with a complete picture of incident scope and impact. Advanced correlation capabilities powered by the [[knowledge-graph|knowledge graph]] help identify affected users, compromised resources, and potential lateral movement paths. The system maintains chain of custody for all digital evidence while respecting [[data-classification|classification requirements]] and [[compliance-framework|regulatory obligations]] throughout the investigation process.

Automated response capabilities include immediate user [[session-management|session termination]], temporary privilege suspension through the [[rbac-model|RBAC system]], and isolation of affected [[workspace-isolation|workspaces]] to prevent incident spread. The incident response system provides collaboration tools for security teams including secure incident workrooms, timeline reconstruction visualizations, and integration with external security orchestration platforms through the [[api-gateway|API gateway]]. All incident data is retained according to specialized [[data-retention-policy|retention policies]] and can generate comprehensive reports for regulatory notifications, executive briefings, and lessons learned documentation.
