Data governance in CollabVault encompasses the comprehensive framework of policies, procedures, and technical controls that ensure organizational data is managed appropriately throughout its lifecycle. This system goes beyond simple access control to address data quality, lineage, ownership, and compliance requirements mandated by the [[compliance-framework|compliance framework]]. Every piece of information within the platform is subject to governance policies that dictate how it can be created, accessed, modified, shared, and eventually disposed of.

The governance engine automatically classifies data upon creation using the [[data-classification|data classification system]], applying appropriate handling rules based on content sensitivity and regulatory requirements. These classifications drive downstream decisions about encryption levels, retention periods defined in the [[data-retention-policy|data retention policy]], and access permissions through the [[rbac-model|RBAC model]]. The system maintains complete data lineage, tracking the origin, transformations, and movement of information across the platform, which is crucial for regulatory reporting and impact analysis.

A key innovation in CollabVault's data governance approach is the implementation of smart contracts that encode governance policies as executable code. These contracts automatically enforce rules such as geographic data residency requirements, cross-border transfer restrictions, and purpose limitation principles required by regulations like GDPR. The governance framework also includes automated data quality monitoring, anomaly detection, and remediation workflows, ensuring that the organization's data remains accurate, consistent, and compliant while being tracked through comprehensive [[audit-logs|audit logging]].
