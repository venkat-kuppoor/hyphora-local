Document retention automation in CollabVault streamlines the complex process of managing information lifecycles according to regulatory requirements and business policies. The system automatically applies retention schedules based on document type, [[data-classification|classification level]], regulatory requirements from the [[compliance-framework|compliance framework]], and business context derived from the [[knowledge-graph|knowledge graph]]. This automation ensures consistent application of retention policies across all platform content including [[wiki-pages|documents]], [[message-channels|messages]], [[file-storage|files]], and metadata.

The retention engine implements sophisticated dependency tracking that prevents premature deletion of documents that are referenced by other content or subject to [[legal-hold|legal holds]], while automatically extending retention periods when documents become relevant to litigation or regulatory investigations. The system provides advanced scheduling capabilities including cascading retention where document disposal triggers evaluation of related materials, and conditional retention that adjusts timeframes based on document usage patterns or regulatory developments.

Advanced automation features include intelligent document classification that improves retention accuracy over time through machine learning, automated retention reviews that flag documents requiring human evaluation before disposal, and integration with [[automated-workflows|workflow systems]] for complex retention decisions requiring multiple approvals. The retention system generates comprehensive [[audit-logs|audit trails]] for all retention actions, enabling organizations to demonstrate compliance with retention requirements during audits. Integration with [[blockchain-audit-trail|blockchain audit systems]] provides cryptographic proof of proper retention handling, while [[compliance-reporting|reporting dashboards]] provide visibility into retention compliance across the organization.
