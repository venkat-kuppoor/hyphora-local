The compliance framework in CollabVault serves as the foundational layer that ensures all platform activities adhere to regulatory requirements across multiple jurisdictions. This framework is not merely an add-on feature but is deeply integrated into every aspect of the platform's architecture, from the [[data-retention-policy|data retention policies]] to the [[access-control|access control mechanisms]].

Built to satisfy regulations such as HIPAA, GDPR, SOC 2, and FINRA, the framework employs a policy-as-code approach where compliance rules are programmatically enforced rather than relying on manual processes. Each action within the platform triggers a compliance check through the [[compliance-engine|compliance engine]], which validates against the configured regulatory requirements before allowing the operation to proceed. This real-time validation ensures that violations are prevented rather than detected after the fact.

The framework maintains a comprehensive [[audit-logs|audit trail]] of all system activities, user actions, and data modifications. These logs are immutable and cryptographically signed, providing irrefutable evidence for compliance audits. Additionally, the framework interfaces with the [[data-classification|data classification system]] to ensure that sensitive information is handled according to its regulatory requirements, automatically applying appropriate encryption, retention, and access policies based on the data's classification level.
