Virtual Data Rooms (VDRs) in CollabVault provide secure environments for confidential document sharing during mergers and acquisitions, legal proceedings, and other sensitive business transactions. Built upon the [[workspace-isolation|workspace isolation]] architecture, VDRs create completely segregated environments with enhanced security controls, detailed access tracking, and time-limited access permissions. Each VDR maintains its own [[encryption-key-management|encryption keys]], [[audit-logs|audit trails]], and access policies, ensuring complete isolation from other platform activities.

VDR functionality extends beyond simple [[secure-file-sharing|file sharing]] to include sophisticated document presentation tools, watermarking with user identification, and granular permission controls that can restrict actions down to individual pages within documents. The system provides detailed analytics on document access patterns, time spent viewing specific sections, and user engagement metrics that help deal teams understand buyer interest and due diligence progress. All VDR activities are subject to enhanced logging requirements and retention periods defined by [[legal-hold|legal hold policies]].

Advanced VDR capabilities include automated redaction tools that protect sensitive information based on [[data-classification|classification rules]], integration with [[biometric-authentication|biometric authentication]] for high-value transactions, and secure communication channels that keep transaction-related discussions isolated from regular business communications. The VDR system supports bulk document uploads with automated indexing and organization, while the [[content-analytics|content analytics]] platform provides insights into document utilization and helps optimize VDR organization. All VDR data is subject to specialized [[data-retention-policy|retention policies]] that account for legal and regulatory requirements specific to transaction documentation.
