Privileged Access Management (PAM) in CollabVault provides specialized controls for administrative and high-privilege accounts that have the potential to cause significant damage if compromised. The PAM system implements just-in-time access provisioning where administrative privileges are granted only when needed and automatically revoked after use, eliminating standing privileges that attract attackers. All privileged access requests go through approval workflows defined in the [[compliance-framework|compliance framework]] with multi-party authorization requirements based on the sensitivity of the requested permissions.

The PAM infrastructure includes privileged session management that records all administrative activities with session replay capabilities for audit purposes. These recordings are stored in isolated, tamper-proof repositories protected by the [[encryption-key-management|key management system]] and retained according to specialized [[data-retention-policy|retention policies]]. Privileged sessions operate within isolated environments that prevent data exfiltration and enforce additional security controls including mandatory [[multi-factor-authentication|MFA]], restricted network access, and enhanced monitoring through the [[threat-detection|threat detection system]].

Advanced PAM features include privilege analytics that identify unnecessary administrative rights through [[role-mining|role mining techniques]], break-glass procedures for emergency access with enhanced [[audit-logs|audit logging]], and privileged behavior analytics that detect anomalous administrative actions. The system integrates with the [[zero-trust-architecture|zero trust architecture]] to continuously verify privileged user identity and intent throughout their sessions. All privileged access activities generate high-priority alerts in the [[incident-response|incident response system]] and are subject to regular review through automated [[compliance-reporting|compliance reports]].
