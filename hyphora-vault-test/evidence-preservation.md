Evidence preservation in CollabVault provides comprehensive capabilities for maintaining the integrity and admissibility of electronically stored information for legal proceedings, regulatory investigations, and internal audits. The system implements forensically sound collection procedures that create cryptographically signed copies of relevant data while maintaining complete chain of custody documentation. Integration with the [[blockchain-audit-trail|blockchain audit system]] provides tamper-proof timestamps and integrity verification that meets legal standards for evidence authentication.

The preservation framework automatically identifies and collects related evidence using the [[knowledge-graph|knowledge graph]] to map relationships between documents, communications in [[message-channels|channels]], and user activities recorded in [[audit-logs|audit logs]]. When preservation orders are issued, the system creates immutable snapshots that capture not only the content but also metadata, version history from the [[versioning-system|versioning system]], and contextual information needed for legal interpretation. The preservation process respects [[data-classification|classification boundaries]] and [[access-control|access permissions]], ensuring that privileged or protected information receives appropriate handling.

Advanced preservation capabilities include selective preservation that captures only relevant information to minimize costs and privacy impacts, cross-jurisdictional preservation that complies with varying legal requirements for international cases through integration with [[cross-border-data-transfer|data transfer controls]], and automated redaction that protects irrelevant personal information while preserving evidentiary value. The preservation system provides specialized export capabilities that generate legally acceptable formats for e-discovery platforms, while maintaining detailed records of all preservation activities for audit purposes. Integration with [[legal-hold|legal hold systems]] ensures that preserved evidence remains protected from normal [[document-retention-automation|retention processes]] until legal matters are resolved.
