The data retention policy system in CollabVault provides automated lifecycle management for all information within the platform, ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements while optimizing storage costs and reducing legal exposure. Retention policies are defined at multiple levels of granularity, from organization-wide defaults to specific rules for individual [[data-classification|data classifications]], workspace types, or content categories, all enforced programmatically through the [[data-governance|data governance framework]].

Retention rules in CollabVault support complex scenarios including legal holds, where specific data must be preserved beyond normal retention periods for litigation or regulatory investigations. The system implements intelligent retention that considers not just age but also business value, access patterns, and dependencies tracked through the [[knowledge-graph|knowledge graph]]. When content reaches its retention limit, the system can either delete it completely with cryptographic verification or archive it to immutable cold storage, with all actions recorded in the [[audit-logs|audit logs]] for compliance demonstration.

The policy engine handles the intricate requirements of multi-jurisdictional compliance by supporting location-aware retention rules that respect data residency requirements and varying regulatory timeframes. Integration with the [[compliance-framework|compliance framework]] ensures that retention policies automatically adjust when regulations change, preventing non-compliance due to outdated configurations. The system also provides retention analytics and reporting capabilities, allowing compliance officers to verify policy effectiveness and identify potential risks from over-retention or premature deletion of critical business records.
