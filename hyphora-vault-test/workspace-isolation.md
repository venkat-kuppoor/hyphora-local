Workspace isolation in CollabVault provides cryptographically enforced boundaries between different organizational units, projects, or classification levels, ensuring that sensitive information remains compartmentalized even within a shared platform infrastructure. Each workspace operates as an independent security domain with its own encryption keys, access policies defined through the [[rbac-model|RBAC model]], and data storage, preventing any possibility of information leakage between workspaces even in the event of software vulnerabilities.

The isolation architecture extends beyond simple access control to encompass complete logical separation at every layer of the technology stack. Network traffic between workspaces is segmented at the infrastructure level, compute resources are isolated using hardware-based virtualization, and data is encrypted with workspace-specific keys managed through the [[end-to-end-encryption|encryption system]]. This defense-in-depth approach ensures that compromise of one workspace cannot affect others, meeting the stringent isolation requirements of the [[compliance-framework|compliance framework]] for handling classified or highly sensitive information.

Cross-workspace collaboration is enabled through carefully controlled interfaces that maintain isolation while allowing authorized information sharing. When users need to share content between workspaces, the system creates sanitized copies that undergo [[data-classification|classification review]] and policy evaluation before transfer. All cross-workspace activities generate comprehensive [[audit-logs|audit log entries]] and may require multi-party approval depending on the sensitivity levels involved. The isolation system also supports hierarchical workspaces, where child workspaces can inherit certain policies from parents while maintaining their own additional restrictions.
